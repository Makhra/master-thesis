# Master Thesis archive: "Benchmark of popular image matching algorithms"

## Introduction

This project is an archive of my MSc dissertation and related source code.
While I do not have much use of this project myself, I hope that sharing my observations/source code could help some future students working on similar project.


## The dissertation

This project involved building a simple social website allowing management and trading of stamps collection between registered users, with the main feature being an image matching mechanism to facilitate identification and classification of stamps previously unknown to the user.

In order to identify the algorithm most suited to this project, a selection of various image matching algorithms has been selected through literature review in aim to test and analyze efficiency and tolerance to defects. Final benchmark including SIFT, SURF, ORB, BRISK and FREAK.


## Code info

 * Social web-site built using Python and Django.
 * Web-scraping of specialized philatelist websites using Scrapy.
 * Images matching algorithms implementations done in Python with the help of the OpenCV library.


## Side-notes

Feel free to judge me on the ugly looking interface on this project, looking into it a few years later I also judge myself... The focus was to get the features in, since this is what a dissertation is graded on ;)
